# dot-files

This repository aims at tracking configuration files normally used by my systems.
Hopefully it will help share these same configurations across systems as well as track any changes that might occur.

## Linking

At the moment the `link.sh` script assumes you have cloned this repository into `$HOME/Develop`. In the future will try to have this script more generic so that it is easier to bring these configurations to different systems.

## To-Do

- Make `link.sh` more generic so that it can be used with different paths
